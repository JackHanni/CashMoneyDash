## Description 
– A description of each team member’s contribution to the build.
* Jack: Movements of main character and enemy Slime, coins and gems, Level 1 design
* Ruimin: Build three Scenes - Portals, Level 2 design, Occlusion

## Details 
– Details regarding any changes made to your core gameplay mechanics based on playtest feedback.

* Free Camera and Main Camera cannot be added as prefab with the character. 

* Instead of ensuring only one character exsists (done by generating a prefab and load in data during transitioning), I decided to put a prefab at the portal and ask the portal just change scene. 

* The tutorial I found for UI does not suit our goal, so I will design on my own or look for other ones that is closer to Mario 64.
