* Jack: Movements of main character and enemy Slime.
* Ruimin: Build three Scenes - MainScreen with Portal, Level 01 using free assets, and Level 02 in ice world using ProBuilder module. 

## Details 
– Details regarding any pivots, rescoping, deviations, erc from your project proposal that you have made or plan to make.


Terrain
* Found interersting assets that made the development process so much easier. A lot of beautiful assets do not support URP. 
* Water seems to be difficult to implement. Will try implement later. 
* The asset I chose does not support PolyBrush Paint. I ended up creating my own landscape in Level02. I still having problem with paint vertex colors but it is not the top priority.
* Some visual items are different from expected. I think we are developing our own game now instead of re-produce Mario.
